    <p>In December 2019, I graduated from the Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University. My degree was in public relations with a business administration minor. Throughout my college career, I worked several jobs and held a couple of different internships that provided me a wealth of experience.</p>
   
    <p>My first internship was at LSU's College of Engineering in the communications department. This position taught me about writing, interviewing for storywriting, social media, and much more. I enjoyed working with the various departments highlighting their research and accolades. In this role, I participated in planning and executing numerous events which I had always had a passion for. I stayed in this role for about two years before moving on to my next internship.</p>
   
    <p>The second internship I had was with a full-service communications agency. The agency had Fortune 50 clients and a wide variety of industries to work with - hospitality, food service, oil and gas, engineering firms, goverment agenices, academic organizations, and non-profits. I was able to work on web projects, development of internal communication networks, app development, and much more that sparked my interest in the technical side of digital communications. I did a deep dive into Google Analytics, search engine optimization, basic HTML, and UTM codes. Other projects included managing the devleopment and strategy behind marketing collateral, social media, strategic planning, event management, and customer relations. In this role, I was able to experience and learn a lot in a short time. I credit this role with a lot of my professional growth as well as the connections I made. As I graduated, I was offered a full-time role that I accepted and thoroughly enjoyed.</p>
   
    <p>From that role, I transitioned to a very similar role at a smaller consulting agency. This is my current role. We work with clients to provide any communication support and strategy needed. This can include visual imagery, website building, internal communication support, external marketing materials, and social media to name a few.</p>
   
    <p>While my professional experience and internships were crucial to my skill development, I had a wonderful educational base from LSU. The program was very hands-on with real clients that we completed projects for as well as stellar faculty who are still mentors to this day. After working for a few years, I decided to further my education by obtaining a master's degree.</p>
   
    <p>In the spring of 2023, I started my journey at the University of Florida's College of Journalism and Communications. This program has been wonderful to continue my education and I couldn't be happier with my decision. Throughout the program, I have been reminded of the endless opportunities available in this industry.</p>

   <h2>Career Goals</h2>

   <p>Moving forward in my career, I would like to continue working in the public relations and communications industry. However, I would like to transition from the agency side to in-house. This would ideally be at a beauty-related company. In two years, I plan to obtain my public relations accrediation through the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA).</p>

   <p>The most important thing to me in my career is to continue learning. My goal is to always learn about new technologies, trends, and insights. From there, I can implement that information and help others to grow as well. Lastly, I want to be a mentor for professionals entering the industry. My mentors have been critical to my succes and growth, so I want to pass that forward. Also, I believe it strengthens the industry. </p>
